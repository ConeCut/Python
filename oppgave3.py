1. b  
   - Value: False  
   - Explanation: The value of b is already set to False.

2. x == 0  
   - Value: True  
   - Explanation: Since x is equal to 0, the expression x == 0 is true.

3. b and x == 0  
   - Value: False  
   - Explanation: b is False, and with the and-operator, the entire expression will be False when the first part (b) is False, regardless of the rest of the expression.

4. b or x == 0  
   - Value: True  
   - Explanation: Even though b is False, x == 0 is True. With the or-operator, it is sufficient for one of the parts to be true for the entire expression to be True.

5. not b and x == 0  
   - Value: True  
   - Explanation: not b becomes True (since b is False), and x == 0 is also True. With the and-operator, both must be true for the entire expression to be true, which they are.

6. not b or x == 0  
   - Value: True  
   - Explanation: not b is True, and x == 0 is also True. With the or-operator, it is sufficient for one of the parts to be true for the entire expression to be true.

7. b and x != 0  
   - Value: False  
   - Explanation: b is False, so the entire expression becomes False regardless of what x != 0 evaluates to.

8. b or x != 0  
   - Value: False  
   - Explanation: b is False, and x != 0 is also False (since x is 0). Both parts are False, so the entire expression is False.

9. not b and x != 0  
   - Value: False  
   - Explanation: not b is True, but x != 0 is False. With the and-operator, both parts must be true for the expression to be true, but they are not.

10. not b or x != 0  
    - Value: True  
    - Explanation: not b is True, and with the or-operator, it is sufficient for one of the parts to be true for the entire expression to be true, even though x != 0 is False.

So the truth values are:

1. False
2. True
3. False
4. True
5. True
6. True
7. False
8. False
9. False
10. True
